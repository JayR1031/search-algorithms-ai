# Search Algorithms AI
## Project Overview
This repository contains implementations of A* and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms for pathfinding and graph traversal, developed as part of my graduate AI coursework at Northeastern University.
## Purpose
The project demonstrates practical applications of fundamental search algorithms in artificial intelligence, comparing their performance, efficiency, and use cases in solving pathfinding problems.
## Implementation Details
- **A* Algorithm**: Implements heuristic-based pathfinding with optimal path guarantees
- **DFS Algorithm**: Explores graph structures using depth-first traversal
- **Performance Analysis**: Comparative study of algorithm efficiency on various graph structures
## My Role
Sole developer responsible for:
- Algorithm design and implementation
- Test case development
- Performance benchmarking and analysis
- Documentation
## Key Outcomes
- Successfully implemented both algorithms with optimal time complexity
- Demonstrated understanding of informed vs uninformed search strategies
- Produced comprehensive performance analysis comparing search strategies
- Applied algorithms to real-world pathfinding scenarios
## Technologies
- Python
- Data structures (graphs, priority queues, stacks)
- Algorithm analysis and optimization
